<p>Urban Search and Rescue efforts, infrastructure assessments, hazardous materials response, and damage assessment operations are ongoing for the communities on the southern edge of the fire. These operations are unprecedented in size and scale and are critical for mitigating existing hazards, confirming missing persons reports, and obtaining accurate number of structures damaged/destroyed.</p>
